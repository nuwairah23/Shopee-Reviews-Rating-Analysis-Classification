# Classification and Visualization of E-Commerce Product Reviews Comparison Using Support Vector Machine 
## Final Year Project
This project aims to develop a web-based system for classifying Shopee product reviews into "Useful" or "Not Useful" categories using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier model. Additionally, it provides visualization tools to analyze and compare products based on their reviews.

## Features:
1. Utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier model.
2. Successfully classifies Shopee reviews data into "Useful" or "Not Useful" categories.
3. Achieved an accuracy rate of 95% in review classification.
4. Provides various analyses on reviews using visualization tools from Python packages such as Plotly.
